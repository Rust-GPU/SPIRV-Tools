# SPIRV-Tools Rust Port Plan

## Goals
- Reimplement SPIRV-Tools functionality in idiomatic Rust with exhaustive type safety (newtypes, enums, traits) so invalid states are unrepresentable.
- Maintain drop-in compatibility with the existing C API by exposing an `extern "C"` surface that mirrors `libspirv` so the Rust code can be swapped in incrementally.
- Keep the port incremental: move the smallest self-contained pieces at a time, land them behind the FFI adapter, and validate behavior with the existing test suite plus new Rust-specific tests.
- Ensure every Rust addition passes `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` and integrates with existing CI expectations.

## Guiding Principles
1. Favor Rust's type system (newtypes, phantom data, `NonZeroU32`, `BitFlags`, typestates) over runtime checks.
2. Keep safety boundaries explicit. Unsafe code is isolated inside `spirv-tools-ffi` shims with documented invariants.
3. Mirror the public API shape of `include/spirv-tools/libspirv.h`. When the Rust implementation is incomplete, delegate to existing C++ implementations via FFI to avoid regressions.
4. Keep changes minimal and focused. Update this plan whenever scope, sequencing, or assumptions change.
5. Tests move with the code. Rust modules own their unit tests; FFI parity is verified with integration tests mirroring the original C tests.

## High-Level Phases
1. **Foundation / Workspace**
    - Introduce a Cargo workspace under `rust/` with crates:
      - `spirv-tools-ffi`: low-level FFI surface powered by the `cxx` crate so we can bind seamlessly with the existing C++ build.
     - `spirv-tools-core`: pure-Rust logic, zero `unsafe`, high-level API.
     - (Future) feature crates for optimizer, reducer, fuzzing, etc.
   - Provide build glue (CMake/Bazel) to compile the Rust staticlib alongside existing binaries.
2. **Core Data Model Port**
   - Port enums (`spv_result_t`, operand types, message severity, target environments, etc.) as Rust enums/newtypes with `repr(transparent)` and conversion traits.
   - Implement fundamental structs (diagnostics, context, target env, message consumer) with safe builders and invariants enforced via typestates.
3. **Binary/Text Infrastructure**
   - Port binary parser/assembler data structures (instruction representation, operand tables) while keeping algorithmic parity.
   - Provide safe APIs for assembling/disassembling modules.
4. **Validator/Optimizer/Tools**
   - Incrementally port validator passes, optimizer transformations, reducer/fuzzer infrastructure, prioritizing components with minimal external dependencies first.
5. **CLIs & Integration**
   - Wire Rust implementations into existing CLI tools through the shared C API.

## Active Milestone: Binary/Text Infrastructure
With the foundational workspace pieces in place, we now focus on the assembler and disassembler pipeline. This milestone delivers a Rust-native text/binary conversion path that can be swapped into the existing C entry points behind the FFI bridge.

Tasks for this milestone:
- [x] Build a strongly-typed lexer/token stream for SPIR-V assembly text that tracks source positions and quotes, so parsing can stay zero-copy where possible.
- [x] Model the intermediate instruction representation (IDs, operands, literal values) with newtypes that enforce the operand kinds the grammar expects.
- [ ] Implement the assembler driver that consumes the lexer, consults the grammar tables, and emits binaries plus diagnostics through the Rust context.
- [ ] Expose the Rust assembler via `try_assemble_text`, returning success/failure and hooking diagnostics into the existing consumers. Fall back to the legacy C++ assembler only while gaps remain.
- [ ] Mirror the improvements in the disassembler path (options filtering, message routing) so both directions benefit from the Rust context.

When the flag is enabled CMake continues to drive `cargo build -p spirv-tools-ffi` (profile configurable via `SPIRV_RUST_PROFILE`) and links the resulting staticlib into the core library while compiling the generated `rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.cc` shim.

Regenerate the bridge artifacts (`rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.{h,cc}`) after editing the Rust FFI surface with:

```
cxxbridge rust/spirv-tools-ffi/src/lib.rs --header > rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.h
cxxbridge rust/spirv-tools-ffi/src/lib.rs --output rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.cc
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests live alongside Rust modules using `#[cfg(test)]` and cover exhaustive enum conversions and validation helpers.
- Cross-language FFI tests ensure the exported symbols maintain the same behavior as the C implementation.
- Long term: reuse/port existing `test/` suites into Rust integration tests.

## Open Questions / Risks
- Determining the best boundary for delegating back to existing C++ code during the transition.
- Build-system integration for consumers that currently rely on CMake/Bazel; for now, manual invocation via `cargo` is sufficient.
- Mapping of large switch-based operand logic into data-driven Rust structures without performance regressions.

## Next Up
1. Layer the typed operand/instruction builder on top of the lexer so we can start translating single instructions and module headers, emitting diagnostics through `ContextHandle`.
2. Teach the Rust assembler driver to consume that typed representation, including ID assignment/preservation, while keeping the C++ fallback until parity is proven.
3. After the assembler path is online, replicate the context plumbing inside the disassembler and ensure GN/Bazel builds can opt into the Rust implementation alongside CMake.
