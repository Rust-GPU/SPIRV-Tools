# SPIRV-Tools Rust Port Plan

## Goals
- Reimplement SPIRV-Tools functionality in idiomatic Rust with exhaustive type safety (newtypes, enums, traits) so invalid states are unrepresentable.
- Maintain drop-in compatibility with the existing C API by exposing an `extern "C"` surface that mirrors `libspirv` so the Rust code can be swapped in incrementally.
- Keep the port incremental: move the smallest self-contained pieces at a time, land them behind the FFI adapter, and validate behavior with the existing test suite plus new Rust-specific tests.
- Ensure every Rust addition passes `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` and integrates with existing CI expectations.

## Guiding Principles
1. Favor Rust's type system (newtypes, phantom data, `NonZeroU32`, `BitFlags`, typestates) over runtime checks.
2. Keep safety boundaries explicit. Unsafe code is isolated inside `spirv-tools-ffi` shims with documented invariants.
3. Mirror the public API shape of `include/spirv-tools/libspirv.h`. When the Rust implementation is incomplete, delegate to existing C++ implementations via FFI to avoid regressions.
4. Keep changes minimal and focused. Update this plan whenever scope, sequencing, or assumptions change.
5. Tests move with the code. Rust modules own their unit tests; FFI parity is verified with integration tests mirroring the original C tests.

## High-Level Phases
1. **Foundation / Workspace**
    - Introduce a Cargo workspace under `rust/` with crates:
      - `spirv-tools-ffi`: low-level FFI surface powered by the `cxx` crate so we can bind seamlessly with the existing C++ build.
     - `spirv-tools-core`: pure-Rust logic, zero `unsafe`, high-level API.
     - (Future) feature crates for optimizer, reducer, fuzzing, etc.
   - Provide build glue (CMake/Bazel) to compile the Rust staticlib alongside existing binaries.
2. **Core Data Model Port**
   - Port enums (`spv_result_t`, operand types, message severity, target environments, etc.) as Rust enums/newtypes with `repr(transparent)` and conversion traits.
   - Implement fundamental structs (diagnostics, context, target env, message consumer) with safe builders and invariants enforced via typestates.
3. **Binary/Text Infrastructure**
   - Port binary parser/assembler data structures (instruction representation, operand tables) while keeping algorithmic parity.
   - Provide safe APIs for assembling/disassembling modules.
4. **Validator/Optimizer/Tools**
   - Incrementally port validator passes, optimizer transformations, reducer/fuzzer infrastructure, prioritizing components with minimal external dependencies first.
5. **CLIs & Integration**
   - Wire Rust implementations into existing CLI tools through the shared C API.

## Active Milestone: Binary/Text Infrastructure
With the foundational workspace pieces in place, we now focus on the assembler and disassembler pipeline. This milestone delivers a Rust-native text/binary conversion path that can be swapped into the existing C entry points behind the FFI bridge.

Tasks for this milestone:
- [x] Build a strongly-typed lexer/token stream for SPIR-V assembly text that tracks source positions and quotes, so parsing can stay zero-copy where possible.
- [x] Model the intermediate instruction representation (IDs, operands, literal values) with newtypes that enforce the operand kinds the grammar expects.
- [ ] Implement the assembler driver that consumes the lexer, consults the grammar tables, and emits binaries plus diagnostics through the Rust context.
  - [x] Cover core module metadata (capabilities, entry points, execution modes, pointer types, and global variables) plus basic block instructions such as loads, stores, and arithmetic.
  - [ ] Support optional operands (memory access masks, alignment), composite instructions, access chains, and control-flow constructs so most shaders assemble entirely in Rust.
    - [x] Parse and encode memory access operands (alignment + pointer scopes) for `OpLoad`/`OpStore`.
    - [x] Extend optional operand coverage to copy-memory instructions (dual masks) and other ops that require literal/ID payloads.
    - [ ] Add composite instruction coverage (e.g., `OpCompositeConstruct`, `OpVectorShuffle`) so complex data assembly no longer falls back.
      - [x] Implement `OpCompositeConstruct`, `OpTypeVector`, and `OpVectorShuffle` translators.
      - [x] Extend coverage to `OpCompositeExtract`, `OpCompositeInsert`, and `OpPhi` boolean helpers. Vector shuffle inputs now reuse tracked type metadata so we reject mismatched component counts/types.
      - [x] Track array/struct layouts to validate composite accesses (including array bounds) and add regression tests covering both valid and invalid cases.
      - [x] Extend the same metadata to matrices (column vectors + column counts) and nested aggregates so multi-level composite extracts/inserts no longer fall back.
      - [x] Track lexer spans on result/type identifiers and surface them through the translator so diagnostics report real line/column information instead of anonymous locations.
      - [x] Support GLSL/OpenCL extended instruction sets (named opcodes, literal integers, rounding modes, variadic operands) so `OpExtInst` can stay in Rust for those imports.
- [x] Expose the Rust assembler via `try_assemble_text`, returning success/failure and hooking diagnostics into the existing consumers. Fall back to the legacy C++ assembler only while gaps remain.
  - [x] Guard the FFI entry points so they fall back to the C++ assembler/disassembler unless explicitly re-enabled. This keeps CI green while we continue fleshing out opcode and option coverage on the Rust side.
    - [x] Allow the Rust disassembler to service `NO_HEADER` requests (and the incidental `PRINT` flag) while leaving other options to the legacy implementation, keeping the fallback behavior explicit in both Rust and C++.
    - [x] Enable byte-offset emission in the Rust disassembler so `NO_HEADER | SHOW_BYTE_OFFSET` requests stay entirely in Rust while unsupported combinations are rejected via typed formatting options.
    - [x] Teach the Rust disassembler to honor the `INDENT` option so CLI clients using `--no-header --no-color --raw-id --offsets` can stay entirely in Rust without losing the aligned opcode formatting.
    - [x] Support friendly-name emission via `BinaryToTextOptions::FRIENDLY_NAMES`, reusing `OpName` payloads when available and synthesizing stable `_N` identifiers so the default `spirv-dis` path (which requests friendly names) remains in Rust unless other unsupported options are toggled.
    - [x] Implement `NESTED_INDENT` so structured control flow is indented using merge information mirroring the C++ formatter, allowing `spirv-dis --nested-indent` to operate entirely within the Rust implementation.
    - [x] Honor the `COMMENT` option by tracking decoration metadata and per-instruction annotations, reproducing the byte-offset/decoration comment stream so `spirv-dis --comment` no longer falls back to C++.
    - [x] Reorder basic blocks on demand when `REORDER_BLOCKS` is set, using a simple CFG walk to mirror structured control-flow ordering so `spirv-dis --reorder-blocks` stays in Rust.
    - [x] Support the `COLOR` flag by injecting ANSI escapes around IDs and comments when requested so `spirv-dis --color` produces colored output entirely in Rust.
- [ ] Mirror the improvements in the disassembler path (options filtering, message routing) so both directions benefit from the Rust context.

## CLI Development
- [x] Introduce a `spirv-tools-cli` crate that wraps the core disassembly logic with `clap`, providing an initial `spirv-dis` binary capable of mirroring the `--no-header`/`--offsets` flags while reading from stdin or files.
- [x] Add `spirv-as` and `spirv-val` binaries so the Rust workspace mirrors the C++ tool surface, sharing reusable helpers for option parsing and file/stdin plumbing. The validator CLI currently delegates to the existing C++ validator over the FFI bridge and is covered by unit + integration tests to guard success/failure paths.

When the flag is enabled CMake continues to drive `cargo build -p spirv-tools-ffi` (profile configurable via `SPIRV_RUST_PROFILE`) and links the resulting staticlib into the core library while compiling the generated `rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.cc` shim.

Regenerate the bridge artifacts (`rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.{h,cc}`) after editing the Rust FFI surface with:

```
cxxbridge rust/spirv-tools-ffi/src/lib.rs --header > rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.h
cxxbridge rust/spirv-tools-ffi/src/lib.rs --output rust/cxxbridge/spirv-tools-ffi.cc
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests live alongside Rust modules using `#[cfg(test)]` and cover exhaustive enum conversions and validation helpers.
- Cross-language FFI tests ensure the exported symbols maintain the same behavior as the C implementation.
- Long term: reuse/port existing `test/` suites into Rust integration tests.

## Open Questions / Risks
- Determining the best boundary for delegating back to existing C++ code during the transition.
- Build-system integration for consumers that currently rely on CMake/Bazel; for now, manual invocation via `cargo` is sufficient.
- Mapping of large switch-based operand logic into data-driven Rust structures without performance regressions.

## Next Up
1. Flesh out the assembler's coverage for optional operands and composite/control-flow instructions (selection/loop merges plus vector/array/struct/matrix composites done; next up matrices with row-major decorations, composite constants, and the disassembler path) so the Rust implementation matches the C++ feature set without falling back.
2. Improve diagnostic positions/line tracking for parser errors so message consumers receive accurate spans, then re-enable the FFI hook in `try_assemble_text` for the contexts/options we fully support.
3. After the assembler path is stable (and the disassembler honours formatting options), replicate the context plumbing inside the disassembler and ensure GN/Bazel builds can opt into the Rust implementation alongside CMake.
4. Keep growing the `spirv-tools-cli` workspace so each legacy CLI has a Rust counterpart with shared Clap parsing, typed configs, and end-to-end tests (once the underlying functionality is ported).
